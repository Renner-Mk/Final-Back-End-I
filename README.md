# API - Task List

## ðŸ¤” About 

This REST(ish) API was built for learning purposes, as an evaluation for the end of the Back-end I module, as I am in the fullstack web development course at [Growdev](https://www.growdev.com.br/). In this module we learned about programming logic, javascript, Rest API, NodeJS, Express, libs and how to upload a back-end application for production, and as the last challenge of this module, we were asked to create this notes API!
